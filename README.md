## Workflow for Developers

### Install Dependencies
Python 3.10
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Prepare Dataset

#### Datasets Used in Papers
Here is a link to
[data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14cli_aVFAocVRCBk0GRllIJwUyj4OTOu?usp=sharing)
user in research.

Choose from:
- nowe (biggest)
- pecherz
- sztuczne (smallest)
- watroba

To run algorithm on them download into `./data/{name}/root/`
and run [combine_preproces](preprocessing/combine_preprocess.py) with relevant parameters.

#### Custom Dataset
In case you want to use custom data, save your data in numpy format like in the example below. \
Place them inside `dane/[custom_name]/root/` directory. \
For real examples please see some code in [`preprocessing`](preprocessing/) 

```
import numpy as np

# Coordinates of pixels in the 2d image
cords = np.array([
    [0, 0],
    [0, 1]
])

# Example m/z values
# IMPORTANT: increasing order and same difference between next elements should be preserved
mz = np.array([
    100, 100.1, 100.2, 100.3, 100.4, 100.5,
])

# Example intensities at specific m/z values
intensities = np.array([
    [0, 75.3, 0.0, 0, 55.2, 72.43],
    [0, 72.3, 0.0, 0, 10.4, 13.01]
])

np.save('data/custom/root/cords.npy', cords)
np.save('data/custom/root/mz.npy', mz)
np.save('data/custom/root/intsy.npy', intensities)
```

After that run [convolve_and_save](preprocessing/convolve_and_save.py) on new data.

### Encoding Algorithm

To train encoder use one of notebooks provided in [notebooks](notebooks). \
Notice that dataloader may use either numpy array or parquet as data source. \
To train on new data set properly dimensions of a network. \
To make it easier, here is the [script](notebooks/suggest_network_parameters.py)
that suggest possible network parameters.

---

### Clustering and Evaluation

To create image clusters run functions from [custer_and_evaluate](cluster_and_evaluate) directory. \
For raw data without applying encoding algorithm use
[original_kmeans.py](cluster_and_evaluate/original_kmeans.py). \
For encoding algorithm results use [contrastive_kmeans.py](cluster_and_evaluate/contrastive_kmeans.py).

Clustering valuation is by default performed after clustering within these scripts. \
In case one writes custom script use [evaluate.py](cluster_and_evaluate/evaluate.py) after clustering.

To analyze clusters visually you can see not only clustered images but also visualize encodings
after applying TSNE or PCA on them. For that reason see
[plot_features_2d.py.py](cluster_and_evaluate/plot_features_2d.py).
